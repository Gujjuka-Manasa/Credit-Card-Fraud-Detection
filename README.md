# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📝 Project Title
**Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Random Forest Classifier**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is one of the most common forms of cybercrime in the financial industry. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions using a real-world dataset. The entire solution is wrapped in an interactive web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to upload their own data, train a model, and predict the legitimacy of new transactions.

## ✨ Features

- 📁 Upload CSV dataset containing credit card transactions
- 👀 Preview the first 10 rows of the uploaded dataset
- 🧹 Automatic detection and removal of missing values
- 🔍 Train a Random Forest Classifier on the dataset
- 📊 Visualize model performance (accuracy and confusion matrix)
- 🧠 Manually input transaction features for live prediction
- ✅ Classify new transactions as **Fraudulent** or **Valid**
